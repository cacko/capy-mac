# capy

monitor macbook audio and video inputs. that's i, you canno record it, just watch it.

## features

* a - toggles always on op behaviour
* f - toggles full screen mode
* esc - ...well

## Use case

it is fairly exotic probably, but what I use it for is to connect chomecast to a macbook and being able to watch it there. it requires some simple and cheap HDMI capure device.

## everyhing eles

build, archive, distribue...etc figure it out, the source uses only avfoundaion as dependencu with macos12 as target. if you want to spend 99$ on apple dev account, you are hopeless.

peace
